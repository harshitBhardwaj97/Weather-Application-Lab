# Weather-Application
Find all the parts of lab related to Weather Application here.

## How to use
The code snapshots are organized in multiple **branches** where every branch **represents a course section**. 

Here I have divided content into parts with their subesquent solutions. 

So **Part-1** branch has the starting code for **First Lab Exercise** and **Part-1-Solution** has the solution for **First Lab Exercise** and so on.


## NOTE
I strongly recommend you to first try exercises on your own, and in case you are absolutely stuck, then only look into solution. Always spend some time and do some efforts to debug the issues, **then only you will become a 10X Engineer in the long run**.
