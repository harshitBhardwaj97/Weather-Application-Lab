## Part-3

Now we are about to finish this project. I have added almost complete working code of this application.

In this part also you will need to use the same API_KEY that was used in the part-2 of exercise. So without a valid API_KEY you won't be able to complete neither part-2 or part-3 (this one).

If you open the components folder, there you will find that I have added the component that is responsible for rendering the Weather Details.

I also have added a complete valid sample-response.json. Now your job is to analyse that response, and based on that, destructure the props and use them WeatherDetails component. For making things easy for you, I already have destructured and used 2 of the elements.

### In order to complete this lab you have to

- Have a valid API_KEY to make applicaiton functional.

- Analyse the sample-response.json and use the destructred props accordingly. Your task is to display all the elements mentioned in the Weather Details components.

## Few important points

- In order to set the correct image src for weather icon, you can check out [this.](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions)

- Don't make any other kind of changes in WeatherDetails.jsx. Do not add or remove any code from there, else the tests will break. There you are just required to use destructred elements. Whatever classnames, comments or other code has been added, please let it be there, and just focus on the current assignment.

  Rest the entire code is in front of you, you can make a local copy of project and make changes in it as you like.
